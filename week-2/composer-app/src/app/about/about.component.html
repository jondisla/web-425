      In 2012, he won the Latin Grammy Award for Producer of the Year. Guerra is
      one of the most internationally recognized Latin artists of recent
      decades. His popular style of merengue and Afro-Latin fusion has garnered
      him considerable success throughout Latin America. He is also credited for
      popularizing bachata music on a global level and is often associated with
      the genre, although his distinct style of bachata features a more
      traditional bolero rhythm and aesthetic mixed with bossa-nova influenced
      melodies and harmony in some of his songs.[5] He does not limit himself to
      one style of music; instead, he incorporates diverse rhythms like
      merengue, bachata-fusion, balada, salsa, rock and roll, and even gospel.
      "Ojalá Que Llueva Café" ("Let's hope it will rain coffee") is one of his
      most critically acclaimed pieces.
